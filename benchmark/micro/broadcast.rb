# Micro-bench: the broadcast render path — a NAMED hot path
# (.claude/rules/performance.md) that had no bench until issue #119.
#
# The transport (Turbo::StreamsChannel) is doubled out to a no-op: we are
# measuring the SERVER-SIDE cost a broadcast pays BEFORE the wire — build +
# render_component (the phlex-rails render_in) + the identity HMAC baked into
# the rendered root — not Action Cable / pgbus delivery.
#
# The point of the bench is the per-CALL multi-KEY cliff. Broadcasting one
# component to K different stream keys (a per-tenant loop — "the list page
# stream AND the dashboard stream") with the classic `broadcast_replace_to` is
# K× build + K× render + K× HMAC for BYTE-IDENTICAL HTML, because `*streamables`
# concatenates into ONE key. `broadcast_replace_to_each` renders ONCE and fans
# the shared payload out over K cheap channel calls. This bench measures the
# gap at 1 key (parity) and over 10 keys (the win).

# Double out the transport: a broadcast bench must not need a running Action
# Cable server (or pgbus's Postgres). We stub every broadcast_*_to entry point
# the benched methods reach to a no-op that returns nil, so what's left is
# purely the server-side build+render+HMAC cost this issue is about.
