              A localhost round trip is ~5 ms — the pending window flashes by
              before you can see it. **Flip the toggle on** and every reactive
              action is delayed client-side, so the affordances below become
              observable. It's a pure client concern: no token, no POST.
            MD
            render Views::Examples::LatencyToggle.new(delay_ms: 500)
            render Views::Examples::LiveExample.new(
              component: LoadingButtonComponent.new(count: 0),
              filename: 'app/components/loading_button_component.rb'
            )
          end
        end

        def disable_with
          DocsUI::Section('busy: — swap the label, disable in flight') do
            md <<~MD
              `on(:save, busy: "Saving…")` swaps the button's text and
              disables it the instant the request is enqueued, reverting when the
              round trip settles. The String is shorthand for
              `busy: { disable: true, text: "Saving…" }` — Livewire's
              `wire:loading` + `phx-disable-with` without a Stimulus controller.
            MD
          end
        end

        def busy
          DocsUI::Section('busy_on — a scoped spinner, styled with CSS') do
            md <<~MD
              `busy_on(:save)` puts `data-reactive-busy` on an element ONLY while
              `save` is in flight. Reveal it with pure CSS — here daisyUI's
              `loading loading-spinner` — no Ruby toggles it. Every reactive root
              also always carries `aria-busy="true"` during any in-flight action,
              so you can style the whole component's wait state with an
              attribute selector.
            MD
          end
        end

        def global_signal
          DocsUI::Section('A global activity signal — like Turbo\'s progress bar') do
            md <<~MD
              The `busy:` / `busy_on` / `aria-busy` hooks above are **per root**.
              For a document-level "is *anything* reactive settling?" signal — a
              global spinner, an "unsaved changes" guard, a test barrier — the
              client also maintains a count of in-flight reactive operations
              (every dispatch round trip **and** every deferred render) across all
              roots, and exposes it two ways:

              - **A marker on `<html>`:** `data-reactive-active` is present while
                the count is `> 0`. Drive a global spinner in pure CSS, the direct
                analogue of `.turbo-progress-bar`:

                ```css
                html[data-reactive-active] .app-spinner { opacity: 1 }
                ```

              - **Events on `document`:** `reactive:busy` fires on the `0 → >0`
                edge, `reactive:idle` on the `>0 → 0` edge (edges only, each
                carrying `{ count }`):

                ```js
                document.addEventListener("reactive:busy", () => showGlobalSpinner())
                document.addEventListener("reactive:idle", () => hideGlobalSpinner())
                ```

              It's purely additive — the per-root markers are unchanged. The
              document marker uses a **distinct** name (`data-reactive-active`, not
              the per-root `data-reactive-busy`) so a `[data-reactive-busy]`
              selector never also matches `<html>`. This is also the primitive the
              [`wait_for_reactive` system-test helper](/docs/testing) waits on.

        def double_submit
          DocsUI::Section('No double-submit — the disable IS the dedup') do
            md <<~MD
              With the latency simulator on, click **Save** twice quickly: the
              count still advances by **one**. A disabled button fires no further
              clicks, so the second press lands on a dead control and never
              enqueues a second POST. The client queue serializes requests per
              component; `busy:` is what dedupes them.
            MD

              md <<~MD
                The latency toggle is a docs convenience, not a gem feature you
                ship. In your own app the simulator is exposed on
                `window.PhlexReactive.enableLatencySim(ms)` when you author
                `<meta name="phlex-reactive-env" content="development">` — see
                [Installation](/docs/installation). Production stays untouched.
