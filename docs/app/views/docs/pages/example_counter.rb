              This is a **real** reactive component rendered right here — not a
              screenshot. Click the buttons; each click POSTs to
              `/reactive/actions`, the server rebuilds the component from its
              signed token, runs the action, and re-renders in place.

              One `include` is the whole setup: `include Phlex::Reactive::Component`
              pulls in `Streamable` automatically. Sign the count into the DOM with
              `reactive_state`, and declare the actions a click may invoke.

              - `reactive_state :count` signs the count into the DOM token. On each
                action the server rebuilds `Counter.new(count: <verified>)`, runs
                the method, and re-renders. The new count is signed into the next
                token automatically.
              - `on(:set, count: 0)` passes an explicit param. Explicit params win
                over any collected form fields.
              - `action :set, params: { count: :integer }` declares a **typed**
                param. The schema is compiled once, at class load — so a typo'd type
                symbol (`{ count: :interger }`) raises
                `Phlex::Reactive::UnknownParamType` immediately, not silently at
                click time. A `:integer` value that won't coerce is dropped and the
                keyword default (`count: 0`) applies, so the action never receives a
                fabricated value.
              - Actions are **default-deny** — only methods declared with `action`
                are invokable. In development and test (`verbose_errors`), an
                undeclared or typo'd action (`on(:increement)`) fails loudly at
                **render** time, listing the declared actions, instead of surfacing
                as an opaque HTTP 403 at click time.
              - **Concurrency is handled.** Click `+` five times fast and you get
                `5` — the client serializes requests per component and threads the
                fresh token through, so rapid clicks don't clobber each other.

                This is record-less on purpose. For anything backed by data, prefer
                `reactive_record` so state lives in the DB.
