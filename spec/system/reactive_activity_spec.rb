# The global reactive-activity signal + the system-test helpers built on it
# (issue #201). The client maintains a document-level in-flight count across ALL
# reactive roots — incremented when a dispatch round trip or a deferred render
# starts, decremented when it settles — and exposes it as a
# <html data-reactive-active> marker plus reactive:busy / reactive:idle events on
# document. TestHelpers::System waits on that primitive so a spec never scrapes
# the union of per-root busy/pending selectors, holds a node a morph detaches, or
# reads a transient blank before a value settles.
#
# Waiting matchers are the barrier for every async hop — never a snapshot right
# after a click.
