# Issue #97: reply.<verb>.js(...) pushes server-side client DOM ops over a
# reactive:js stream, emitted AFTER the render streams. The decisive end-to-end
# proof: after a save that morphs the component AND focuses a sibling field, the
# freshly morphed field is the active element — which only holds if the op stream
# ran on the POST-morph DOM (ops last, per the ordering contract). If the op ran
# before the morph, it would focus a node about to be replaced and focus would be
# lost.
#
# Runs under BOTH real servers (Puma default, Falcon via CAPYBARA_SERVER=falcon):
# a reactive round trip must work sync AND async.
