# The deliberately-expensive rollup for the defer suite (issue #165) — the
# SessionTotals stand-in from the issue's reps-logger story. `render_delay_ms`
# is a class-level dial the request/system/latency specs turn to simulate a
# cross-aggregate rollup's cost; the default 0 keeps every other spec fast.
#
# It is a full reactive component (controller + fresh action token on the
# root) so the suite can prove a deferred render ARRIVES INTERACTIVE, and it
# defines deferred_placeholder so `placeholder: true` has a component-authored
# skeleton to pick up.
