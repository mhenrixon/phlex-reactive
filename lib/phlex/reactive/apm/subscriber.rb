      # name-only payload + duration to the resolved adapter's record_action —
      # so the APM names the transaction `Component#action` and tags the outcome.

      # A plain ActiveSupport::Notifications subscriber (NOT a LogSubscriber): a
      # LogSubscriber dispatches by the FULL event method, but we want the SAME
      # record_action for both action and defer events and to hold a reference to
      # the adapter instance. install/uninstall manage exactly one subscription so
      # a re-attach with the same adapter never double-reports.
