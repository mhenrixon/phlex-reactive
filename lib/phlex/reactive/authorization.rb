    # tracking cell, an interceptor that marks it when a configured authorization
    # method returns, and the enforcement decision the endpoint calls after an
    # action runs.
    #
    # The design mirrors Phlex::Reactive.with_connection_id: a fiber-local cell
    # (Thread.current, which is fiber-local in Ruby, so Falcon's fiber-per-request
    # model is safe) saved and restored around the action. Because tracking is a
    # WINDOW — anything marking during the action counts — authorization performed
    # in a HELPER the action calls is detected too, not just a top-level call.
