    # them into wire streams at the ENDPOINT, after the action's transaction
    # committed — so a rolled-back action can never leak a directive — and picks
    # the delivery lane:
    #
    #   * pull (:fetch)  — the directive carries a purpose-scoped, short-TTL
    #     defer token; the client POSTs it to the defer endpoint OFF the action
    #     queue and applies the rendered stream when it lands. Works on every
    #     transport (it's just HTTP) — this is the universal lane.
    #   * push (:stream) — pgbus durable one-shot stream + ActiveJob: the reply
    #     carries a signed SSE src; a job renders and broadcasts durably, and
    #     the since-id=0 replay closes the broadcast-before-subscribe race.
    #     Capability-gated (Phlex::Reactive.defer_push_capable?); anything
    #     missing degrades to pull.
