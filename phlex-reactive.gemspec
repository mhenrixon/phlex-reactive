  spec.summary = "Reactive Phlex components for Rails — Livewire-style actions and live cross-tab updates, no Stimulus boilerplate."
  spec.description = <<~DESC
    phlex-reactive makes Phlex components reactive without writing Stimulus
    controllers or hand-picking Turbo Stream targets. Declare actions in Ruby;
    a single generic client runtime turns clicks and form input into a server
    round trip that re-renders the component and morphs it back in. Components
    self-target by a stable DOM id, so the same unit re-renders for client
    actions AND server-pushed broadcasts. State lives in the database behind a
    signed identity — no attacker-controlled snapshot. Pairs with pgbus for
    reliable, transactional, reconnect-safe live updates with no Action Cable
    and no Redis.
